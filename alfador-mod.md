Alfador's mod content v0.1.0
Intended content:

Diapers, watersports, better support for non-binary player pronouns/titles.



Checklist:
* [partially done!] Config options to turn off the content
* [in progress] Diaper clothing objects with the capacity to hold fluids, like milk pumps and used condoms do. If capacity is less than 50% used, will not count as dirty. If leaking option is enabled, will leak at over 100% capacity.
* [in progress] Urine fluid with the ability to voluntarily urinate during sex and masturbation scenes. Will instantly dirty non-diaper objects.
* [NYI] Bladder filling over time, ability to urinate restricted when depleted, if option for incontinence content is enabled a full bladder can cause accidents 
* [NYI] Diaper store to sell diapers and adult baby clothes. Folks in this world don't know they're associated with babies in player character's world...
* [NYI] Enchantments to increase/decrease continence, increase/decrease bladder fill rate, cause uncontrollable wetting?
* [NYI] Fetishes!
  * Wearing diapers/ABDL clothes
  * Wetting diapers
  * Omorashi/wetting non-diaper clothes
  * Leaking diapers
  * Peeing on sex partner / getting peed on
  * Drinking pee / having pee drunk
  * Tickling (can induce accidents)
  * Derived fetish: ABDL clothes + any diaper fetish + lactation (breastfeeding) fetish = Adult Baby
* [NYI] Options to choose pronouns and honorifics to use for Androgynous characters so the game doesn't just default to the gender binary.
* [ongoing] Partial nudges in the direction of enby-friendliness here and there, like not always calling vaginal secretions "girlcum".
* [NYI] Possibility of scat content. Changes from the WS content:
  * Any amount of poop in a diaper immediately makes it dirty, no need for filling to 50%.
  * No analogue to pee-drinking scenes/fetishes because I do NOT want to write or test that.
  * Separate colon capacity, separate bowel continence, separate enchantments, separate fetishes including for blowouts vs. leaking
  * Easier to hold it in at high/max capacity.
* [NYI] Secret bonus scenes???

Fixes TODO:
* Change Bladder implementation in Body to no longer be mandatory at load and instead generate as default if not present. Should unbreak old save file loading which I assume to be broken but haven't even tested as of writing this.
